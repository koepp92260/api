Short Term:
* Try and run Typo or similar over ackbar
* See if I can add a :finder_block & :counter_block similar
  to the *_sql variety. Will need to Submit patch to Rails to allow
  overriding of acceptable keys.
* Test if handling binary data through KBBlobs is better

Mid Term:
* Get the mixins working
* Run KirbyBase in client/server mode
* Run through a real web server with FCGI/SCGI etc.

Long Term:
* Use KB indexes if they exist
* Integration with KB's Lookup and Link_many
* Find a solution to joins (and thus to eager associations)
